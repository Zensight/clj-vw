## Usage and documentation

Except when only using client related code (see [online.clj](doc/clj-vw/clj-vw.online.html)), this
library requires that vowpal wabbit is installed in the usual way.  Basic knowledge of vowpal
wabbit, its [command line
options](https://github.com/JohnLangford/vowpal_wabbit/wiki/Command-line-arguments) and [input
format](https://github.com/JohnLangford/vowpal_wabbit/wiki/Input-format) are recommended. See the
[vowpal wabbit tutorial](https://github.com/JohnLangford/vowpal_wabbit/wiki/Tutorial) for more
information.

Codox documentation is available in html format under [doc](doc/index.html) after. It is be
generated by issuing the command `lein doc` in the repository's root directory. There are three
namespaces.

* [core.clj](doc/clj-vw.core.html)
  Core functionality for interacting with vowpal wabbit in a generic way (input example formatting,
  writing data files, passing options and calling vw, ...)

* [offline.clj](doc/clj-vw.offline.html)
  Higher level helper functions for interfacing to a local vowpal wabbit installation.

* [online.clj](doc/clj-vw.online.html)
  Higher level helper functions for launching and connecting to a (local or remote) vowpal wabbit
  running in daemon mode.

Besides the codox documentation, example use cases are provided in the tests.

## Testing

On the command line, issue `lein test`. Requires that vowpal wabbit is installed and that the
directory `"/tmp/"` is read/writable.
